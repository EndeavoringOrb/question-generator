### Problem Generator

This is a project that generates questions/problems like those that would be in a homework assignment.  

The idea is that for each problem set you would specify a topic (i.e. polynomials) and what the student needs to do for a problem (i.e. factor, then solve for x) and then the program will generate a problem set tailored to those specifications.

in prompts/section/answerStart.txt it should be  
name/topic on line 1 (i.e. Polynomials) and  
goal for problems on line 2 (i.e. solve for x)
